  "description": "By constructing a virtual constellation of complementary types of satellites, we integrated the merit of high spatial resolution Landsat data with that of high temporal frequency MODIS data, to produce a high spatial-resolution and temporally consistent, better data set overcoming a number of shortcomings that conventional Earth observation (EO) data have, including cloud effects, data damage or loss. To do so, we developed a spatial-temporal remote sensing data reconstruction and fusion framework with an automated, serverless production chain on the AWS. Based on it, weproduced the seamless data cube (SDC) at a 30 m spatial resolution and daily interval in an analysis-ready-data (ARD) format. The constructed fine-grained SDC will significantly reduce the preprocessing burden of users, broaden the use of remotely sensed data to a wider range of communities, and give us the capacity of near-real-time EO. Such kind of data is a long-term dream in the remote sensing and application community, that has never been realized before. The data set will promote new knowledge discovery on patterns, and benefit the land science community for biophysical, and socio-economic information extraction from the ARD data, making it easy and convenient to assess various policy goals such as conservation of protected areas, supporting international policy making on climate change mitigation, and raising awareness on environmental issues. The knowledge gained from thisuniquely comprehensive data set will form a new foundation for achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Develop Goals (SDGs).",

Agriculture-Vision aims to be a publicly available large-scale aerial agricultural image dataset that is high-resolution, multi-band, and with multiple types of patterns annotated by agronomy experts. In its current stage, we have captured 94,986 512x512images sampled from 3,432 farmlands with nine typesof annotations: double plant, drydown, endrow, nutrient deficiency, planter skip, storm damage, water, waterway and weed cluster. All of these patterns have substantial impacts on field conditions and the final yield. These farmland images were captured between 2017 and 2019 across multiple growing seasons in numerous farming locations in the US. Each field image contains four color channels: Near-infrared (NIR), Red, Green and Blue.  We first randomly split the 3,432 farmland images with a 6/2/2 train/val/test ratio. We then assign each sampled image to the split of the farmland image they are cropped from. This guarantees that no cropped images from the same farmland will appear in multiple splits in the final dataset. The generatedAgriculture-Vision dataset thus contains 56,944/18,334/19,708 train/val/test images.",
